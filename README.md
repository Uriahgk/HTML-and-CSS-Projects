# HTML and CSS Projects
This is where I've made sample websites using HTML and CSS.

## Projects
### The Kaiju Zoo.
This is a example of a fake zoo that has large monsters known as "kaiju" from different movies and a couple from norse mythology.
It's styled with CSS and includes image containers, a navbar and a form.

### Academy Cinemas.
This is a example of a Home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4. It includes many Bootstrap components
including but not limited to navbar, jumbotron, form, cards and dropdowns.

### Portfolio Website.
This was the first draft of my portfolio website styled with CSS. It includes a navbar, images, columns, a video and form.
